			<description>This session will explore the duties, responsibilities and challenges faced by a Treasurer of a not-for-profit organization. In addition to maintaining monthly oversight and report presentations, the Treasurer should be actively involved in setting annual budgets and preparing year-end working papers for audits or financial reviews.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What kind of time commitment should be allocated? Are there financial support services that can help to streamline the organization�s operations? What are the Canada Revenue Agency deadlines that must be adhered to?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take part in the conversation and contribute your experiences. This session is appropriate for both large and small organizations.  In addition to those holding a Treasurer�s position, Managers, Executive Directors, Board and Executive Members will find this session useful.&lt;br /&gt;

COMMON ALIENS / Group Show&lt;br /&gt;
New Artwork &amp; Mixed Media from the Gallery's Archives&lt;br /&gt;
Curated by Ross McArthur&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring Micheal DeForge (Toronto, Canada), Dave Cooper (Ottawa, Canada), Scooter LaForge (New York), Hayden Menzies (Toronto, Canada) &amp; Graham Robinson (Toronto, Canada).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
February 13 - 28, 2015&lt;br /&gt;
Vernissage Friday February 13 / 7 - 10pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Statement:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To live in a community, as we have all experienced, is an act of optimism. The struggle for human connection is beautiful and strange and important. We are each faced with the common task of reaching out toward one another, defying the isolation of our own minds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Common Aliens brings together a collection of diverse figurative works to populate the gallery with a congregation of familiar strangers; bizarre, vulgar, amplified, deconstructed, careful and arbitrary bodies, not entirely unlike our own and those of the people around us. All the parts of a human are present. We may begin to recognize ourselves in the images, but the connection will always be imperfect. Common Aliens explores and expands that imperfection, inviting a sense of alienation as a tool to investigate the distance between ourselves and the world, and to find comfort in the confusion. - Ross McArthur, 2014&lt;br /&gt;

			<description>You are invited to HUB &amp; Spoke, HUB Ottawa's signature networking event, and HUB's first event focusing solely on the arts!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On February 19th from 5:30pm to 8pm, join us for a drink and meet artists in Ottawa from all disciplines. Join us in talking about interdisciplinary art initiatives, getting excited about the creative possibilities of interdisciplinary work, and celebrating art initiatives happening across the city of Ottawa. In addition to hearing speakers from various arts organizations, we will feature a giant interactive map of Ottawa's art initiatives, providing artists with opportunities to create connections between their projects and find ways to collaborate with each other. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HUB is excited to be partnering with the Undercurrents Festival, capping off the evening by travelling to Arts Court to see "SPIN" at 9pm, an interdisciplinary theatre show by Evalyn Parry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
