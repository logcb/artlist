The struggle for human connection is beautiful and strange and important. We are each faced with the common task of reaching out toward one another, defying the isolation of our own minds.\r\r\r\rCommon Aliens brings together a collection of diverse figurative works to populate the gallery with a congregation of familiar strangers; bizarre, vulgar, amplified, deconstructed, careful and arbitrary bodies, not entirely unlike our own and those of the people around us. All the parts of a human are present. We may begin to recognize ourselves in the images, but the connection will always be imperfect. Common Aliens explores and expands that imperfection, inviting a sense of alienation as a tool to investigate the distance between ourselves and the world, and to find comfort in the confusion. - Ross McArthur, 2014",
